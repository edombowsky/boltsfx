# Bolt - The Fastest Way to Build a Server

## Overview

Bolt automates a significant portion of the VSS9 server build process. 

## Running

The following environment variables must be set:
- TOP
- CDS_TOP
- OS
- VIEW
- SERVICE_SUITE_VERSION
- WLS_DIR
- ADVANTEX_dbInstance
- ADVANTEX_dbPassword
- export ADVANTEX_dbUser

For example:
```shell
export TOP=$PWD/TOP
export CDS_TOP=$PWD/CDS_TOP
export OS=LINUX
export VIEW=$PWD
export SERVICE_SUITE_VERSION=95.0.0
export WLS_DIR=$PWD/TOP
export ADVANTEX_dbInstance=dellr815c_r12102
export ADVANTEX_dbPassword=emd1
export ADVANTEX_dbUser=emd1
```

The variables `ADVANTEX_dbInstance`, `ADVANTEX_dbPassword`, and `ADVANTEX_dbUser` are normally set when the `$TOP/etc/profile.service_suite` gets called during the login process. This is because thes values are stored in the vssrt file in an encrypted form and need to be decrypted.
